              <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>

              <p>I am a Teaching Fellow at Durham University with a background in astrophysics and science
              communication. I love teaching physics and science to students and the public. I have
              taught a variety of courses covering classical mechanics to exoplanets via lectures, practical
              laboratories, tutorials, and computing workshops as well as supervising research projects.</p>

              <p>I have previously held research fellowships at the University of Hull, prior to which I completed a
              postdoc at the University of Exeter. I first discovered my love of computational methods in astrophysics
              during my undergraduate studies toward a MSc (Hons) in Physics with Theoretical Astrophysics at the
              University of Nottingham. After that I moved on to the University of Central Lancashire, where
              I was awarded my PhD on the topic of Chemodynamical Adaptive Mesh Refinement Simulations of Galaxies.</p>

              <p>My research work is about the formation and evolution of galaxies. I use computer simulations to model
              the formation and evolution of spiral galaxies. My research interests include the processes which shape
              galaxies and the chemical elements are produced in the Universe. To this I use some of the worldâ€™s most
              powerful supercomputers, without which these sophisticated hydrodynamics models would be impossible.</p>

              <p>I give talks to schools, public audiences, astronomy clubs, and science festivals. People seem 
                to think I'm interesting to listen to, and if you're interested in having me talk to your group
                then get in touch today at <a href="mailto:c.gareth.few@gmail.com">c.gareth.few@gmail.com</a></p>
