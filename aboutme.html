              <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>

              <p>I am a Teaching Fellow at the University of Durham with a background in astrophysics and science
              communication. I love teaching physics and science in general to students and the public. I have
              taught a variety of courses covering classical mechanics to exoplanets via lectures, practical
              laboratories, tutorials, and computing workshops as well as supervising research projects.</p>

              <p>I have previously held research fellowships at the University of Hull, prior to which I completed a
              postdoc at the University of Exeter. I first discovered my love of computational methods in astrophysics
              during my undergraduate studies toward a MSc (Hons) in Physics with Theoretical Astrophysics at the
              University of Nottingham. After that I moved on to the University of Central Lancashire, where in 2013
              I was awarded my PhD on the topic of Chemodynamical Adaptive Mesh Refinement Simulations of Galaxies.</p>

              <p>My research work is about the formation and evolution of galaxies. I use computer simulations to model
              the formation and evolution of spiral galaxies. My research interests include the processes which shape
              galaxies and the chemical elements are produced in the Universe. To this I use some of the world’s most
              powerful supercomputers, without which these sophisticated hydrodynamics models would be impossible.</p>

              <p>In addition to probing the universe I also enjoy various nerdy hobbies, chair the Hull branch of the
              British Science Association and co-chair Beverley’s Cafe Scientifique. I can be found on Twitter,
              Speakezee, LinkedIn and ResearchGate and contacted via email c.gareth.few@gmail.com</p>
